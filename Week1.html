			While going through the lab, one of the first things I saw that could be improved was to install docker first since in step one it mentioned launching a docker shell on your laptop.

			Another suggestion would be to let the student know that they would need to create an account to download docker so that they are aware of what they nee to do.  

			In my installation it mentioned that Hyper-V would need to be enabled and would affect VirtualBox, which in my case it did and I was unable to access one of my VMs. This would be another instance where it would be beneficial to let the student know so that they are prepared in case one of their machines becomes inoperable.

			Since this was my first time operating docker, I had to search on how to initially start up and get the software working, and there was a page on the docker website that helped me and suggest linking within the instructions.

			While many of the steps were straightforward and understandable, the docker create command step caused me great frustration and took me far too long to get it working since it did not specify how to recreate and split the command to continue on the next line, but the rest of the instructions included detailed explanations on how to get through it.  I believe this may be a wall for some students and should include a note on how to type the command as it is presented in the image.
